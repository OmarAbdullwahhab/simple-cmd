# simple-cmd
Simple application to help developer make simple interactive command line application in java
# for developers
  - implement the CommandLineOptionListener interface for each application you want to use,
  - do not include the exit option in the implementation as its implemented by the application already.
  - have a look at the SimpleApplication class to see a very simple implementation for it.

# in the nearst future
  - will include command line options/args
