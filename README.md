# simple-cmd
Simple application to help developer make simple interactive command line application in java
# For developers
  - Implement the CommandLineOptionListener interface for each application you want to use,
  - Do not include the exit option in the implementation as its implemented by the application already.
  - Have a look at the SimpleApplication class to see a very simple implementation for it.

# In the nearst future
  - Will include command line options/args
